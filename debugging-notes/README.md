# Debugging Notes 

This folder documents real issues I faced while building and deploying the AWS student Management cloud Backend.

Instead of hiding failures, I intentionally documented them to show:
-> How cloud system actually fails.
-> How i diagnosed issues step by step.
-> What i learned from each problem 

So, actuallt these notes reflects real-world backend and cloud debugging experience.

Most issues were related to **AWS networking and security configuration**, not
application code. These notes reflect real-world challenges encountered while
working with VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2, Lambda, and RDS PostgreSQL.
